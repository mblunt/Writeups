SQL Database
Ok this was something Iâ€™m decent at (finally ._.)
Weird security function...
Given a form that directly queries a MySQL database
Found out later that LIMIT 20 was at the end
After some enumeration, tables are:
To_derezz
Programs
Iso(whatever else)
SELECT * FROM programs ORDER BY 1 --
Ctrl-f Tron
Got the flag
Alternative would have been to use sqlmap, but that's really noisy and the hosts may not like that too much.
