Flask
Ugh, this one annoyed me so much
It requires you to be admin to see the flag
Tried editing cookies, popped an error
I was able to see a couple lines of code, specifically how the cookies were used in determining the status of the user
Tried to get an interactive shell, required a pin
Probably not supposed to do it that way anyways
Come back later - Teammate solved it with my help
