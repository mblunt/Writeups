KIOPTRIX 1
Apache Server
Kioptrix is running Apache 1.3.20 with a Redhat kernel
Method 1: Web Exploit
Ran OWASP-ZAP against the server
Spider showed some interesting pages
http://ip-addr/manual/mod
Checked it out, showed LOTS of information
SSL version
Perl mods
Very interesting and useful stuff
Method 2: Version Exploit
Use the OpenF*** program from searchsploit (764.c)
Tried to compile, got a ton of errors…
Google: Compiling errors with OpenF***
There is a nice Medium article explaining how to fix it.
Fixed and complied, seemed to compile fine.
./764 0x0b 192.168.93.129 443 -c 40
I had to restart the Kioptrix to get this to work
Ran the executable again, got a non-interactive root shell
No netcat, pty.spawn isn’t working
/bin/sh -i works
YAY

Samba
Kioptrix is running samba smbd (2.2.1a)
Need a samba scanner? Look in exploitdb!
Or not :(
Use metasploit scanners
Use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
Returns: 2.2.1a
Use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumshares
