Hacker vs Hacker

Apache 2.4.41 Ubuntu
appears to be an apache webserver
Notice a submission for “CV”/resume immediately after
attempted to submit random file and saw a note left by a “hacker”
they uploaded a shell via the CV input, probably a php shell
Gobuster found a directory called “cvs”
Not like the drug store, probably where resumes get stored
Maybe I can execute a php rev shell from here
Also in HTML of upload.php
 seriously, dumb stuff:


$target_dir = "cvs/";
$target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"]);


if (!strpos($target_file, ".pdf")) {
  echo "Only PDF CVs are accepted.";
} else if (file_exists($target_file)) {
  echo "This CV has already been uploaded!";
} else if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
  echo "Success! We will get back to you.";
} else {
  echo "Something went wrong :|";
}
Breaking it down, check for a pdf file, then allows if extension is correct.
Also, no positional check, so it can be revshell.pdf.php
This appears to be the initial exploitation route, however it may have been patched by the original hacker. Try searching for their revshell in /cvs/. The hint says they were “sloppy” so it is probably still there.
