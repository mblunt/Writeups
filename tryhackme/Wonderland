can run python3.6 on the python file
root.txt and python file
root is only readable by root (duh)
python file calls a python module random, i can hijack this 
make a file called random.py
just turn it into a shell spawner
it will import random which just spawns a shell
sudo -u rabbit /usr/bin/python3.6 /home/alice/walrus_and_the_carpenter.py
