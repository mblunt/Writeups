doesnt work for ssh, but logs me into wordpress web interface.
Wordpress User
confused on what to do now for a bit
reread the hit and it said “ure_other_roles”
googled it and found a priv esc in wordpress
https://vk9-sec.com/wordpress-plugin-user-role-editor-4-24-privilege-escalation/
followed steps on this website to priv esc wendy to wpadmin
added phprevshell to Hello Dolly, used pentestmonkeys shell
saved edits and hit activate on the code
boom revshell
Revshell (www-data)
bash -i
export TERM=xterm
user flag:
0052f7829e48752f2e7bf50f1231548a
hint points to python modules being the weakness
all python modules belong to the group “family”
jack is a member of the group family
family can write/modify all python modules…
this is not a normal configuration…must be part of priv esc
Oops that is the next step lol, jack→root
note hints at backup permissions being a problem
cd /var/backups
ls -la reveals a chmod 777 id_rsa file
ssh -i id_rsa jack@jack.thm
Jack Shell
added a python revshell into the base64 module, and it works but no priv esc?
I need to find a way to get root to trigger a python module…
There must a python file on the machine that runs either with SUID or regularly
Nothing in /etc/crontab
/opt/statuscheck/checker.py
read the log and it runs every 2 minutes
appears to be run by root…
uses the “os” module!!!!
Exploit
very simple, just took the file read from gtfo bins
root = open(“/root/root.txt”).read()
open("/tmp/root.txt","w+").write(root)
watch ls /tmp
root.txt :)
