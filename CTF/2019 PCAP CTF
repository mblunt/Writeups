EASY

The easy portion of the networking CTF was designed to be solvable with nothing more than google. 

The flag in this exercise was the password used by 192.168.163.128 to authenticate via telnet with 192.168.163.129. The participant was provided with the above instructions, and given a pcap file and wireshark. 

Select any of the telnet files and select “Follow → TCP Stream”
Then, scroll down until you see the username and password, both in clear text.

ANSWER: “msfadmin”


EASY+

The easy+ section was designed to require slightly more work, but also requires nothing beyond knowledge of the use of the TCP/HTTP Stream function.

The flag in this exercise was simply the domain name of the website (ex: google.com). The participant was given a pcap file and instructed to find the domain name of the website that the user was accessing.

Narrow the search using the filter option “http”
You will notice that all but one of the outbound http requests are going to 199.232.33.67, and can reasonably assume that this is the website asked about.
Select any of these HTTP files and follow either the HTTP or TCP Stream.
The host is shown in clear text at the top of the page

ANSWER: “cnn.com”

MEDIUM

The Medium section is a significant step up from Easy and Easy+, and presents a slightly more difficult objective.

The flag in this image is an unencrypted PNG image sent from 192.168.163.128 to 192.168.163.129. It was sent via netcat after 192.168.163.128 telneted into 192.168.163.129.

Follow the TCP stream, and adjust the stream number until you are at string 3.
Turn the display form from ASCII text to Raw.
Save the raw text as a png.

ANSWER: “EARTH”
