Immediately notice pcap and play on TFTP (trivial file tp)
Tftp is unencrypted, should be able to export whatever was transferred easily.
file-->export objects-->save all
Instructions.txt
Wack. seems to be encoded text?
Pictures:
All bmp and all weird dimensions, something steganography based?
Program.deb:
No clue, some tar files?
Uncompressed the control tar, it is steghideâ€¦
Earlier assumptions may have been correct, try it on the photos?
Data tar is just md5sums for steghide
