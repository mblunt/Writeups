General Setup

You are going to want to use the Web GUI. Much easier to operate and much more user friendly. Only problem is that it needs to be accessed from a remote computer, ie: not the computer running Pfsense. Shouldn’t be a problem at PCDC.

Accessing Web GUI (presuming you have console access)

On console boot up, you should see LAN and WAN.
These two options should have IP addresses next to them.
To navigate to the web GUI, simply type the address into a new tab, and log into the system using credentials.
Default credentials are:
USER - “admin”
PASS - “pfsense”
Go to the setup wizard
Step 4 
Here you can change static IP address 
Make sure to block bogon net and RFC1918 Networks
Step 6 
Change admin password
WRITE ON ENUMERATION SHEET
Go to the Advanced 
Admin Access
Scroll to the bottom, Check (Password protect the console menu)
SAVE















Snort - Installation and Setup

From Web GUI:
Open Web GUI
Go to System/Package Manager/Available Packages
Search “Snort” in search bar
Install it
Go to Services/Snort
Turn on all rules, and type in your code
Then Update the rules Under the Update tab.
Configure As Needed
