PFSense Configuration
For PCDC

Setup
Use a 24V power supply with the router
Connect an ethernet cable to eth1 and a PC
Set ip addr of PC to 192.168.1.11 (just not 1.1)
Subnet mask to 255.255.255.0
Open web browser to 192.168.1.1

Login
Should be on 192.168.x.1
Access using: 
Web Browser
SSH
Telnet (if enabled)
Step 1:
Navigate to “Users” tab
Click “Add User”
Username - NetAdmin
Full Name - Network Administration
Password - NETWORK_password_123!
Delete default user “ubnt”
Click “Actions”
Click “Delete”

Firewall Basics
Click “Firewall/NAT”
Click “Firewall Policies”
“Allow Established/Related”
Allows connections initiated from within to pass through firewall.
DISABLE THIS
Adding a new rule
Click “Actions” on “WAN IN”
“Edit Ruleset”
Click “Add New Rule”
Basic
Name the Rule (ex: Block Web)
Enable the rule
Click “Drop” (or Accept)
Click “TCP and UDP” (or All Protocols)
We still want ICMP to work so they know its up, so I chose “TCP and UDP”

Advanced
Check the “New, Established, and Related” boxes
Source
Specify an Address (ex: 192.168.1.10)
Leave blank for all
Specify a Port/Range
Leave blank or put 1-65535 for all
Specify a MAC Address
Unnecessary unless you get Layer 2 devices
Destination
Specify an Address (ex: 192.168.1.10)
Specify a Port (ex: 22)

Notes:
Use the log function in the pfsense firewall rules to solve problems, it can be very useful but it only holds 500 packets so be careful.

I want to find a wireshark display filter that will allow me to view established connections lasting greater than a specified time interval. Wireshark has an inbuilt timestamp on each packet, and can follow TCP and UDP streams, but can it filter based on connection time?
