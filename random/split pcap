Split Writeup
Things I immediately Noticed:
All traffic is between 172.16.238.10 and 172.16.238.11
All TCP except stuff at the top
Split Q1:
What port is the receiver listening on? 59381
Super simple, just look for the destination port in Conversations.\
Split Q2:
How many TCP streams were sent in the capture? 1121
Very straightforward, multiple ways to do this but I just used Conversations.
Shows 1121 TCP streams with the earmark 3 way handshake
Verified with display filter
tcp.stream eq 1120 is last result, 1121 because of stream 0
Split Q3:
Probably packet reassembly, each TCP PSK packet has 1 character in it (ASCII)
Filter with data and use LUA script to export only data section of packet and append it all together to get flag
